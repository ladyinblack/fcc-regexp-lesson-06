### [Find More Than the First Match](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/find-more-than-the-first-match)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
If you have multiple occurrences of your regex inside a string, you can get the `match()` function to detect all of them.  Simply tag along the `g` flag at the end of your regex!  That's what you're doing in this challenge.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
Change the regex so that it detects the word "twinkle".
### Hint 2
You can add multiple tags to a regex!  For example, a regex that detects multiple occurrences, and detects regardless of case, can be structured like `gi` or `ig`.
